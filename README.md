# Kasparro Backend – ETL & API System

This project implements a **Dockerized ETL + API backend** for cryptocurrency market data as part of the Kasparro backend assignment.
The system supports **scheduled ETL ingestion**, **manual ETL execution**, **persistent storage**, and **public API access**, and is fully deployed on **AWS EC2**.

---

## 🚀 Deployed Backend (AWS)

**Public API Base URL (AWS EC2):**

```
http://13.204.43.83:8000
```

### Available Endpoints

* **Health Check**

  ```
  http://13.204.43.83:8000/health
  ```

* **Ingested Market Data**

  ```
  http://13.204.43.83:8000/data
  ```

* **ETL Run Statistics**

  ```
  http://13.204.43.83:8000/stats
  ```

> ✅ Deployment is live on AWS EC2 (bonus criteria satisfied)

---

## 📦 What This System Does

### Data Sources

* **CoinGecko** (BTC, ETH historical CSV ingestion)
* **CoinPaprika** (Global crypto market snapshot via API)

### ETL Features

* Incremental ingestion
* Persistent checkpoints
* ETL run tracking (`success`, `failure`, duration, record count)
* Recovery-safe (can re-run ETL after restart)
* Scheduled ETL using **cron inside Docker**

### API Features

* Health monitoring (`/health`)
* Paginated & filtered data access (`/data`)
* ETL history & metrics (`/stats`)
* PostgreSQL-backed persistence

---

## 🐳 Dockerized Architecture

The system runs using **Docker Compose** with two services:

* **api** – FastAPI + ETL + cron scheduler
* **postgres** – PostgreSQL database with persistent volume

Everything starts automatically via Docker.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally (Same as AWS)

### Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose

### Start the System

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Verify

```bash
docker ps
```

---

## 🔁 Running ETL Manually

ETL also runs on a **cron schedule**, but can be triggered manually:

```bash
docker-compose exec api python services/run_etl.py
```

After running ETL, verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/stats
curl http://localhost:8000/data
```

---

## 🧪 Automated Tests

The project includes a full automated test suite using **pytest**.

### Covered Areas

* API health endpoint
* Data pagination
* Source-based filtering
* ETL side effects
* ETL statistics
* Database connectivity

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

✅ All tests pass successfully.

---

## ☁️ AWS Deployment Details

* **Platform:** AWS EC2 (Ubuntu)
* **Runtime:** Docker + Docker Compose
* **Public Access:** Port 8000 open for API
* **ETL Scheduling:** Cron inside API container
* **Logs:** Accessible via Docker logs
* **Database:** PostgreSQL with Docker volume

## 🔐 Evaluator: SSH Access & Self-Run Instructions

### SSH into EC2

```bash
ssh -i <your-key>.pem ubuntu@13.204.43.83
```

### Navigate to Project

```bash
cd kasparro-backend-shreyas-bhat-k
```

### Start Services

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Trigger ETL (Optional)

```bash
docker-compose exec api python services/run_etl.py
```

### View Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs api
docker-compose logs postgres
```

---

## 🧠 Notes

* No external API authentication is required for this assignment.
* All secrets and configuration are handled via environment variables.
* Evaluators can verify everything **without modifying code**.
